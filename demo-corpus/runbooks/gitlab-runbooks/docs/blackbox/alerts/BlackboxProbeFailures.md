# BlackboxProbeFailures

## Overview

- The alert BlackboxProbeFailures is designed to notify you when the success rate of probes executed by the Blackbox exporter falls below 75% for 10 minutes. The instances in `gprd` are taken into consideration by the alert excluding the following
  - `https://ops.gitlab.net/users/sign_in`
  - `https://dev.gitlab.org.*`
  - `https://pre.gitlab.com`
  - `https://registry.pre.gitlab.com`
  - `https://status.gitlab.com`
  - `https://new-sentry.gitlab.net`

- A variety of factors can cause a probe to fail: a GCP outage, Cloudflare event, expired SSL certificate, or a breaking change.

- The service affected depends on the endpoint the probes failed for, the team owning the service can be determined in the [Service Catalog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/services/service-catalog.yml?ref_type=heads) by searching for the service name.

- The recipient is supposed to check if the endpoint is reachable; if not, check for logs and try to figure out the cause of a endpoint being unreachable, and then fix it or escalate it.

## Services

- [Blackbox Exporter Service](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/blob/master/README.md)
- Team that owns the service: [Scalibility:Observability](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/team/scalability/observability/)

## Metrics

- The metric in the provided Prometheus query is based on the success rate of probes executed by a Prometheus blackbox exporter. Link to the [metrics catalog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/mimir-rules/gitlab-gprd/blackbox_alerts.yml#L5)

  `avg_over_time(probe_success{...}[10m]) * 100 < 75`: This part of the query calculates the average success rate over the past 10 minutes. The probe_success metric indicates whether the probe was successful (1 for success, 0 for failure). Multiplying by 100 converts this rate to a percentage. The condition < 75 triggers the alert if the average success rate falls below 75%.

- Given the reliance on DNS and network connectivity, the blackbox thresholds are chosen to minimize false alerts for minor and transient problems outside our control. It's still possible that a false alarm could result, but even if there is a non-service related cause for more than 10 minutes, we would want the engineer on call to be aware of it.

[Alert Normal](AlertNormal.png)

- Any presence of a the metric below 75 shows some failures of the probes.

## Alert Behavior

- We can silence this alert by going [here](https://alerts.gitlab.net/#/alerts), finding the `BlackboxProbeFailures` and click on silence option. Silencing might be required if the alerts is caused by an external dependency out of our control.

- This alert is fairly common, past hits can be seen [here](https://nonprod-log.gitlab.net/app/r/s/vIAAl)

## Severities

- The incident severity can range from Sev4 to Sev1 depending on the endpoint.
- The impact depends on the endpoint being affected, as failures on certain endpoints will impact our customers.
- [Handbook Link]( https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/#incident-severity) to better decide the severity of the incident.

## Troubleshooting

- The blackbox exporter keeps logs from failed probes in memory and exposes them over a web interface.
  You can access it by using port forwarding, and then navigating to `http://localhost:9115`

  ```bash
    ssh blackbox-01-inf-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal -L 9115:localhost:9115
  ```

Please note that the exporter will only keep up to 1000 results, and drop older
ones. So make sure to grab these as quickly as possible, before they expire.

- The troubleshooting process might differ depending on the endpoint that the blackbox probes failed for.
  - A good place to start is to trying figure out if it is an internal or external dependency.
  - A recent deployment could have caused this issue and a good place to confirm it would be checking the web service [dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/web-main/web3a-overview?from=now-6h%2Fm&orgId=1&to=now-1m%2Fm&var-environment=gprd&var-stage=cny&viewPanel=1806708210).
    - The next step in that case would be to contact the release managers and disabling canary and blocking deployments due to the incident
  - Check for [GCP](https://status.cloud.google.com/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/) outages reported on their public status pages to see if they coincide with the downtime.
