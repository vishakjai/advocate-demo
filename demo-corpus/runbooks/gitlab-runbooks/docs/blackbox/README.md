## Result logs

The blackbox exporter keeps logs from failed probes in memory and exposes them over an HTTP interface.

You can access it by using port forwarding, and then navigating to `http://localhost:9115`:

```
ssh blackbox-01-inf-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal -L 9115:localhost:9115
```

Please note that the exporter will only keep up to 1000 results, and drop older
ones. So make sure to grab these as quickly as possible, before they expire.
