## Overview

## CI Runner Shard Performance Degradation (Apdex Score)

This alert indicates that a specific **CI runner shard** is not meeting its **performance targets**, as measured by its **Apdex score** for job execution. The **Apdex score** evaluates the ratio of jobs that complete within a satisfactory response time versus the total job execution attempts for the given shard. A drop in this score suggests that **CI job execution performance is degrading**, impacting developer workflows and overall pipeline efficiency.

### Impact

- Delayed job execution on the affected shard
- Increased pipeline duration, leading to slower feedback loops
- Jobs stuck in a **pending** state, waiting for available runners
- Potential **timeout failures** if jobs exceed execution thresholds
- Queue buildup, increasing job wait times and impacting CI/CD throughput

### Contributing Factors

Several factors can lead to degraded CI runner performance and a lower Apdex score, including:

- **Resource saturation** on runner managers, causing job execution slowdowns
- **TLS certificate issues**, leading to authentication failures for API requests
- **Network connectivity problems**, impacting job retrieval and execution
- **Docker image pull delays**, slowing down job startup times
- **GCP quota limitations**, restricting the availability of compute resources
- **Configuration changes** affecting runner behavior or performance settings
- **Auto-scaling limitations**, preventing the timely provisioning of additional runners

This alert helps detect and diagnose such issues early, enabling corrective actions to restore normal CI job execution performance.

## Metrics

### Primary Alert Metrics

- [gitlab_runner_acceptable_job_queuing_duration_exceeded_total](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/metrics-catalog/services/ci-runners.jsonnet#L198-230)

```promql

# Job Queuing Duration

gitlab_runner_acceptable_job_queuing_duration_exceeded_total

# Shard Apdex Score

gitlab_component_shard_apdex:ratio_1h{component="ci_runner_jobs"}

# Job Queue Duration
gitlab_runner_job_queue_duration_seconds_bucket

# Machine Creation Rate
gitlab_runner_autoscaling_machine_creation_duration_seconds_count
```

### Other Metrics to check

- Machine states (creating/running/removing)
- CPU utilization per runner manager
- Network egress rates
- Docker image pull times
- Job execution states

### Normal vs Alert State Patterns

Normal state:

- Queue duration p95 < 2 minutes
- Pending jobs < 1000
- Machine creation success > 95%
- Apdex score > 0.82

Alert state:

- Queue duration p95 > 10 minutes
- Pending jobs > 7000
- Machine creation success < 80%
- Apdex score < 0.82

## Alert Behavior

This alert:

- Triggers when both 6h and 30m windows breach thresholds
- Requires minimum operation rate
- Often correlates with resource saturation
- May indicate configuration issues

Common patterns from incidents:

- Peak traffic periods
- Post-deployment issues
- Certificate rotation events
- Infrastructure scaling events
- Weekend capacity adjustments

## Severities

Default severity is `~severity::3` but should be upgraded to `~severity::2` if:

- Multiple shards affected
- Customer-facing shared runners impacted
- Queue times > 15 minutes for > 30 minutes
- Affects > 10% of total jobs

Severity 4 when:

- Single internal shard affected (e.g. `private` or `gitlab-org` shard)
- No customer impact
- Recovers within 15 minutes

## Troubleshooting

Based on incident [#18667](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/18697):

### 1. Verify Shard Status

- Check if a specific shard is affected, for example, by using the `json.shard` filter in Kibana.
- Common shards that have shown issues: `private`, `gitlab-org`, `tamland`
- Most issues appear in these shards due to resource constraints

### 2. Check Runner Manager Logs

```bash
# Verify runner and machine status
sudo docker-machine ls

# Check runners cert expiry
sudo cat /root/.docker/machine/certs/ca.pem | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
sudo cat /root/.docker/machine/certs/cert.pem | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
```

### 3. Machine Creation Investigation

```bash
knife ssh -C 10 'roles:gitlab-runner-base-gce' 'sudo cat /root/.docker/machine/certs/ca.pem | openssl x509 -noout -enddate' | sort -k5
```

### 4. Performance Analysis

- Check [CI runners overview dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ci-runners-main/ci-runners3a-overview)
- Monitor Runner saturation metrics
- Review job queue duration trends

### 5. Recovery Verification

After changes:

- Check if the Apdex score is improving

- Monitor pending jobs queue length
- Verify jobs are being processed normally
