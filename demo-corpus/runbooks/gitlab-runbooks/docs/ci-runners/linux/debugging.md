# Hosted Runners Debugging Guide

Debugging a hosted runner involves two main steps:

1. Verifying a runner-manager's ability to spin up ephemeral VMs.
2. Ensuring the ephemeral VMs can connect to GitLab.com or the CI Gateway.

## Quick Overview

## Part 1: Testing Ephemeral VM Creation

The most challenging aspect of testing runner-managers is composing the `docker-machine` command with all the required custom options. These options vary by manager, so we've created handy scripts to automate this process.

### Using `generate-create-machine.sh`

This script is typically located in the `/tmp` folder of runner-manager VMs. It generates another script based on the configurations in the `/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml` file of each runner-manager.

#### Steps to Run

```bash
$ sudo su
# cd /tmp
# export VM_MACHINE=test1
# ./generate-create-machine.sh
# less create-machine.sh  # Review the generated script
# ./create-machine.sh     # Run the script
```

#### Example Output of a Successful Run

```plaintext
tmp# ./create-machine.sh

To connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on this VM, run: docker-machine env test1
```

## Part 2: Testing Ephemeral VM Connectivity

Once the ephemeral VM is created successfully, you can verify its connectivity.

### Steps to Test Connectivity

```bash
# docker-machine ssh test1
cos@test1 ~ $ curl -IL https://us-east1-c.ci-gateway.int.gprd.gitlab.net:8989
cos@test1 ~ $ curl -IL https://gitlab.com
```

#### Expected Outcome

- A successful call will return a `200` status code.

- If any command times out, it may indicate a network misconfiguration.

## Part 3: Connecting to a running job

If there is a problem in an existing job that is still running, it is possible to connect to it directly. Note that this should only be done for our own workloads.

### Get the runner-manager

This is visible on the web page for the job logs. Either on the top right, or in the logs themselves.

It will look something like this:

```
Running with gitlab-runner 18.4.0~pre.115.gb2218bab (b2218bab)
  on blue-4.saas-linux-small-amd64.runners-manager.gitlab.com/default J2nyww-sK, system ID: s_cf1798852952
```

This needs to be translated into the actual hostname, which in this case would be:

```
runners-manager-saas-linux-small-amd64-blue-4.c.gitlab-ci-155816.internal
```

This mapping is implicit, but can be discovered via:

```
host="$(cd ~/code/chef-repo && knife node list | grep -vE '^INFO:' | fzf -0 -1 | awk -F: '{print $1}')"
if [[ -n $host && "$hostname" != *".internal" ]]
then
  host="$(cd ~/code/chef-repo && knife node show "$host" | grep -vE '^INFO:' | yq '.FQDN')"
fi
```

Or via:

```
knife search 'roles:runners-manager' --attribute 'fqdn' --attribute 'cookbook-gitlab-runner.runners.default.global.name' --format json | grep -vE '^INFO:' | jq -r '.rows[].[]|[.fqdn, ."cookbook-gitlab-runner.runners.default.global.name"]|@tsv' | sort -n
```

### Get runner (job VM) and container

This is also in the job logs and looks like this:

```
Running on runner-j2nyww-sk-project-75050198-concurrent-0 via runner-j2nyww-sk-s-l-s-amd64-1759673243-5f16ceff...
```

The second part is the job VM, the first part is the container name on that job VM.

### SSH into the job

Now we have all the pieces to get a shell inside of the job.

First, SSH into the runner-manager:

```
ssh runners-manager-saas-linux-small-amd64-blue-4.c.gitlab-ci-155816.internal
```

Next up, SSH into the job VM. We do this through `docker-machine`.

```
iwiedler@runners-manager-saas-linux-small-amd64-blue-4.c.gitlab-ci-155816.internal:~# sudo -H docker-machine ssh runner-j2nyww-sk-s-l-s-amd64-1759673243-5f16ceff
```

This is a containerd-based container-optimized OS. It is possible to run a toolbox:

```
cos@runner-j2nyww-sk-s-l-s-amd64-1759673243-5f16ceff ~ $ toolbox
```

As well as docker commands. We can now get a shell inside of the job container:

```
cos@runner-j2nyww-sk-s-l-s-amd64-1759673243-5f16ceff ~ $ docker exec -it runner-j2nyww-sk-project-75050198-concurrent-0-d0c939fb2a356dee-predefined bash
```

## Debugging Step-Based Jobs (GitLab Functions)

Jobs that use [GitLab Functions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#steps) execute through a step-runner gRPC service inside the build container, using a bootstrap → serve → proxy pattern. This section covers how to debug issues specific to step-based execution.

For a general overview of step-based execution and common errors, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting-guide.md#troubleshooting-step-based-execution-gitlab-functions).

### Enable Debug Logging

For verbose step-runner output in the job log, set the `CI_FUNCS_LOG_LEVEL` CI/CD variable to `debug` on the job or project:

```yaml
variables:
  CI_FUNCS_LOG_LEVEL: debug
```

### Verify Bootstrap

The bootstrap stage copies the `gitlab-runner-helper` binary into the build container's shared volume.

1. Check for the `docker_bootstrap` stage in the job logs. A successful bootstrap will show the bootstrap container being created and exiting with code 0.

2. If you have access to the job VM, verify the binary exists in the container:

    ```bash
    docker exec <build_container> ls -la /opt/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper
    ```

    The binary should exist and be executable (`-rwxr-xr-x`).

3. Verify the bootstrap volume is mounted:

    ```bash
    docker inspect <build_container> --format '{{json .Mounts}}' | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A5 "/opt/gitlab-runner"
    ```

### Inspect Serve Process

In step-based jobs, the build container's main process is the helper binary running in serve mode.

1. Check the container's main process:

    ```bash
    docker exec <build_container> ps aux
    ```

    You should see a process like:

    ```
    /opt/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper steps serve bash
    ```

    If instead you see just `bash` or `sh` as PID 1, the job is using traditional execution, not steps.

2. Confirm the step-runner started successfully by checking for the **"step-runner is ready."** message in the job log. If this message is absent, the serve process did not initialize.

3. Check the container's command configuration:

    ```bash
    docker inspect <build_container> --format '{{json .Config.Cmd}}'
    ```

    For step-based jobs, this will include `steps serve` in the command chain.

### Container Inspection

Inspect step-related volumes and mounts on the job VM:

```bash
# List all volumes for the build container
docker inspect <build_container> --format '{{json .Mounts}}' | python3 -m json.tool

# Check for the /opt/gitlab-runner volume specifically
docker inspect <build_container> --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{if eq .Destination "/opt/gitlab-runner"}}Type={{.Type}} Source={{.Source}} RW={{.RW}}{{end}}{{end}}'
```

The `/opt/gitlab-runner` volume should be present and writable.

### Log Patterns

Step-based execution produces different log patterns compared to traditional execution:

**Step-based execution**:

- A `docker_bootstrap` stage appears before the build starts (`ExecutorStageBootstrap` internally).
- The bootstrap container is created and started with the command `gitlab-runner-helper steps bootstrap /opt/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper`.
- The build container command is prefixed with `/opt/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper steps serve`.
- Once the gRPC service is ready, the job log prints **"step-runner is ready."**.

**Traditional execution**:

- No bootstrap stage.
- No `/opt/gitlab-runner` volume creation.
- The build container runs the shell command directly (e.g., `bash`, `sh`).

### Unix Socket Verification

The step-runner gRPC service communicates over a Unix socket inside the build container. On Linux, the default path is `/tmp/step-runner.sock`.

1. Verify the socket exists:

    ```bash
    docker exec <build_container> ls -la /tmp/step-runner.sock
    ```

    The socket should be present as a socket file (type `s`).

2. If the socket does not exist, the serve process likely failed to start or has crashed. Check the container logs:

    ```bash
    docker logs <build_container>
    ```

3. Verify the serve process is still running (see [Inspect Serve Process](#inspect-serve-process) above). If the serve process has exited, the socket will no longer accept connections, and the proxy will fail to communicate with the step-runner.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issue: Network Misconfiguration

One frequent issue is a missing network configuration for the CI Gateway. Ensure that the network is allowed in the [CI Gateway configuration](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/blob/7a5022fafbcd268e34b3f08b4d86aea8699db328/environments/gprd/variables.tf#L224).

If problems persist, verify the VM’s network settings and access permissions.
