# CI Runner Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Runner Issues and Resolutions

### Runners Manager is Down

There are a wide range of possibilities, although uncommon, for when the runners manager is failing to process jobs.

The reason could be anywhere between the GitLab instance and the runner-manager VM itself.

#### Possible checks

1. Try to login to the problematic node and run `sudo gitlab-runner status`. If the `gitlab-runner` process is not running (output is `gitlab-runner: Service is not running!`), then check that `chef-client` is enabled before attempting to start the process again.
1. Is the issue occurring in only one VM in a given shard? This could indicate the issue is local to that specific runner-manager.
1. Is the issue widespread in all the VMs in a particular shard? This could indicate a faulty configuration, either in Terraform or Chef.
1. Is the issue widespread in all .com hosted shards? This indicates an issue with the GitLab instance, or some other intermediate component; for example, the HAProxy nodes.

#### Resolution

Depending on the cause, the resolution can range anywhere between restarting the `gitlab-runner` process, to reverting a recent change.

### CI runner manager report a high number of errors

#### Possible checks

1. Check the CI Runners Incident Support dashboards [in Grafana](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboards/f/ci-runners/ci-runners).
2. Check the Failures by instance and reason in [this dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/goto/D8gWNgAHg?orgId=1).
3. Check [.com runner logs](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/r/s/f7x01) for unexpected increase in a particular error.
4. Examine a failed job in detail.
5. SSH into one of the runner-manager VMs experiencing the errors, for example:

   ```bash
   ssh runners-manager-private-blue-1.c.gitlab-ci-155816.internal
   ```

6. Check the status of machines:

   ```bash
   $ sudo gitlab-runner status
   $ sudo su
   # /root/machines_operations.sh list
   # /root/machines_operations.sh count
   ```

7. You can also do a check using Docker Machine:

   > **Notice:**
   > `docker-machine ls` is doing an API call for each machine configured on the host. This might increase the
   > GCP quota Limits usage. Please use this command carefully and consider to skip this step if
   > we're approaching any of the quota limits for an affected project.

   ```bash
   $ sudo su
   # docker-machine ls
   ```

   Save this output for later troubleshooting.

8. Check the process logs as described in [docs general troubleshooting tips](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/faq/#general-troubleshooting-tips).

## Troubleshooting Step-Based Execution (GitLab Functions)

GitLab Runner supports executing CI jobs using [GitLab Functions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/#steps), where job scripts are run through a step-runner gRPC service inside the build container. This section covers how to identify and troubleshoot issues with step-based execution.

### Architecture Overview

Step-based jobs follow a **bootstrap → serve → proxy** pattern:

1. **Bootstrap**: A short-lived container copies the `gitlab-runner-helper` binary into a shared volume at `/opt/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper`.
2. **Serve**: The build container starts with the helper binary wrapping the original shell command: `/opt/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper steps serve <shell>`. This starts a gRPC server listening on a Unix socket (default Linux path: `/tmp/step-runner.sock`) and then launches the original shell command. When the gRPC service is running, the job log will print **"step-runner is ready."**.
3. **Proxy**: The runner communicates with the gRPC service by exec-ing `/opt/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper steps proxy` inside the build container, which tunnels gRPC requests over stdin/stdout to the Unix socket.

### Identifying Step-Based Jobs

To determine if a job used steps vs traditional execution:

- **Check for the bootstrap stage**: Step-based jobs will show a `docker_bootstrap` stage (implemented as `ExecutorStageBootstrap`) in the runner logs before the build container starts.
- **Look for the serve process**: In step-based jobs, the build container's main process is `/opt/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper steps serve <shell>` instead of the shell directly.
- **Look for the ready log**: A successfully started step-runner will emit **"step-runner is ready."** in the job log.
- **Check feature flags**: The runner feature flag `FF_SCRIPT_TO_STEP_MIGRATION` controls whether `script` jobs are migrated to the step-runner path.

### Enabling Debug Logging

To get more detailed logs from the step-runner during a job, set the following CI/CD variable on the job or project:

```yaml
variables:
  CI_FUNCS_LOG_LEVEL: debug
```

This causes the step-runner to emit verbose logging in the job output, which is useful for diagnosing step execution issues.

### Common Errors

#### "helper does not contain CI Steps support"

```
helper does not contain CI Steps support: please upgrade your version of the GitLab Runner helper binary
```

**Cause**: The helper binary is too old and does not include the `steps` subcommand.

**Resolution**: Upgrade the runner to a version that ships a helper image with GitLab Functions support.

#### Bootstrap Failures

Errors during the bootstrap stage, such as:

```
bootstrap container non zero exit: <error> (<status_code>) <output>
```

**Possible causes**:

- Volume mounting issues: the temporary volume for `/opt/gitlab-runner` could not be created or mounted.
- Helper image pull failures: the helper image could not be pulled from the registry.
- Network issues: the bootstrap container runs with `NetworkDisabled: true`, but the image must already be available.

**Investigation**: Check the runner-manager logs for the full bootstrap container output. Verify that the helper image version matches the runner version.

#### Serve Failures

The serve process fails to start or crashes inside the build container.

**Possible causes**:

- The build container command was not correctly prefixed with the helper binary path.
- The binary at `/opt/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner-helper` is missing or corrupt (bootstrap did not complete successfully).
- Socket creation failure: the serve process could not bind to `/tmp/step-runner.sock`.

**Investigation**: Inspect the build container logs. Check if the binary exists and is executable inside the container. If the **"step-runner is ready."** message does not appear in the job log, the serve process did not start successfully.

#### Proxy/Communication Failures

The runner cannot communicate with the step-runner gRPC service inside the build container.

**Possible causes**:

- The Unix socket at `/tmp/step-runner.sock` is not accessible.
- The serve process exited before the proxy could connect.
- Docker exec failures when running the proxy command.

**Investigation**: Check if the serve process is still running. Verify the socket file exists in the container. Check Docker daemon logs for exec failures. Enable [debug logging](#enabling-debug-logging) to get more detail.

### Mitigation

If step-based execution is causing issues and needs to be disabled quickly:

#### Disable Step Migration on the Runner

Set `FF_SCRIPT_TO_STEP_MIGRATION` to `false` in the runner configuration under `[runners.feature_flags]`:

```toml
[[runners]]
  [runners.feature_flags]
    FF_SCRIPT_TO_STEP_MIGRATION = false
```

This disables the migration of `script` jobs to the step-runner path.

## Shared Runners Cost Factors

> Available for GitLab.com Admins only

Cost Factor is a multiplier for every CI minute being counted towards the Usage Quota.

`Public` Cost Factor is applied to `public` projects jobs, `Private` Cost Factor is applied to `private` and `internal` projects jobs.

For example, if `Public` Cost Factor of the Runner is set to `0.0`, it would NOT count the time spent executing jobs for `public` projects towards the Usage Quota at all.

Similarly, if `Private` Cost Factor of the Runner is set to `1.0`, it would count every minute spent executing jobs for `private`/`internal` projects without applying any additional multiplier to the time spent.

Setting a value, different from `0.0` and `1.0`, could be used to adjust the "price" of a particular runner.
For instance, setting the multiplier to `2.0` will make each physical minute to consume 2 minutes from the quota.
Setting the multiplier to `0.5` will make each physical minute to consume only 30 seconds from the quota.

It is possible to adjust Cost Factors for the particular runner:

1. Navigate to **Admin > Runners**
2. Find the Runner you wish to update
3. Click edit on the Runner
4. Edit Cost Factor fields and save the changes

Cost Factors are stored in the `ci_runners` DB table, in `public_projects_minutes_cost_factor` and `private_projects_minutes_cost_factor` fields.

Default Cost Factors values are `public_projects_minutes_cost_factor=0.0` and `private_projects_minutes_cost_factor=1.0`.

### Abuse of network resources

[Recent incidents](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/issues/6451) have shown elevated levels of egress traffic from VMs. This is an ongoing investigation.

For traffic irregularities investigation, see [Google Cloud Metrics Investigation](providers/gcp/metrics.md) to analyze sent bytes metrics and correlate with system logs.

### Abuse of resources: Cryptocurrency mining

The most common known pattern of abuse is cryptocurrency mining.

Because we limit wallclock minutes, not CPU minutes, miners are motivated to spawn numerous concurrent jobs, to make the most of their wallclock minutes.

Miners often create numerous accounts on GitLab.com, each having its own namespace, project, and CI pipeline. Typically these projects have nearly identical `.gitlab-ci.yml` files, with only superficial differences. Often these files will maximize parallelism, by defining many jobs that can run concurrently and possibly also specifying that each of those jobs should individually be run in parallel.

### Surge of Scheduled Pipelines

When creating a scheduled pipeline in the GitLab UI there are some handy defaults. Unfortunately, they result in a lot of users scheduling pipelines to trigger at the same time on the same day, week, or month.

The biggest spike is caused at 04:00 UTC. This spike is increased on Sundays (for jobs scheduled to be weekly) and on the first of the month (for jobs scheduled monthly). If the first of the month is also a Sunday this is additive and the spike will be even larger.

In the case of a scheduled pipeline surge triggering the alert, it should resolve within ~15 minutes. If it doesn't it likely indicates there's more than just the one cause of the alert (e.g. there is a scheduled pipeline surge **and** abusive behavior in the system)

### GitLab.com usage has outgrown it's surge capacity

Each runner manager tries to maintain a [pool of idle virtual machines](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-cookbooks/chef-repo/-/blob/master/roles/gitlab-runner-srm-gce.json#L19)
to assign to new jobs. This allows jobs to start as soon as they're assigned without waiting for the VM spin-up time. However, if the idle pool is exhausted and new jobs keep coming in, the new jobs will have to wait for availble VMs.

This scenario actually describes the above two scenarios as well, however because the idle count is a hard coded value per runner manager, over time it will need to be updated as usage on GitLab.com grows.

#### How to identify active accounts (namespaces) with large number of pending CI jobs?

To find accounts (a.k.a. namespaces) with large number of pending CI jobs, use the following DB query which finds top 10 namespaces with most number of CI jobs in the `Pending` state.

```psql
##
## Find one of the CI hosts
## If needed use the [host-stats dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/bd2Kl9Imk/host-stats?orgId=1)
##
$ ssh patroni-ci-v14-03-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal
$ sudo gitlab-psql
gitlabhq_production=# SELECT namespace_id, count(id) FROM ci_pending_builds GROUP BY namespace_id ORDER BY count(id) DESC LIMIT 10;
## Example output
 namespace_id | count
--------------+-------
     13264837 | 43325
     33264816 | 32295
     28868183 | 20800
     53264790 | 14618
     33264804 | 14016
     23264777 | 12374
     13264797 |  9838
     32510040 |  8730
     53264820 |  8406
     66778311 |  5470
(10 rows)
```

These namespace ids are all that the abuse-team needs to block the accounts and cancel the running or pending jobs, so if the situation is dire, skip ahead to the "Mitigation" step.

Caveats:

- Normally the namespace called "namespace" can be ignored. It is an "everything else" bucket for the many small namespaces that did not rank in the top-N that get individually tallied. Usually you can ignore it, but if it has an outrageously high count of jobs, that might indicate there are numerous namespaces being collectively aggressive in scheduling jobs (which would warrant further research).
- Namespace 9970 is the `gitlab-org` namespace and is expected to routinely have heavy CI activity.

#### Investigation

To translate these namespace ids into namespace names and URLs, you can (a) run `/chatops gitlab run namespace find <id>`, (b) query the Rails console, or (c) query the Postgres database directly.

##### Option A: ChatOps command

The easiest way is to use this ChatOps command in Slack to lookup the namespace name:

```
/chatops gitlab run namespace find <namespace_id>
```

##### Option B: Database query

Connect to any Postgres database (primary or replica) and get a `psql` prompt:

```shell
ssh <username>-db@gprd-console
```

or

```shell
ssh patroni-01-db-gprd.c.gitlab-production.internal   # Any patroni is fine, replica or primary.
sudo gitlab-psql
```

Put your namespace ids into the IN-list of the following query:

```sql
select
  id,
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  'https://gitlab.com/' || path as namespace_url
from
  namespaces
where
  id in ( 6334677, 6336008, ... )
order by
  created_at
;
```

##### Option C: Rails console query

Connect to the Rails console server:

```shell
ssh <username>-rails@gprd-console
```

For a single namespace id:

```ruby
[ gprd ] production> Namespace.find_by_id(6334677)
```

For more than a single id, put your namespace ids into the array at the start of this iterator expression:

```ruby
%w[6334677 6336008].each { |id| n = Namespace.find(id); puts "#{id} (#{n.name}): https://gitlab.com/#{n.full_path}" }
```

##### Review the namespaces via the GitLab web UI

To view the namespace (and its projects), you will probably need to authenticate to GitLab.com using your admin account (e.g. `msmiley+admin@gitlab.com`) rather than your normal account, since abusive projects tend to be marked as private.

Often (but not always), both the namespace and the project are disposable, having minimal setup and content, apart from the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that defines the pipeline jobs. For reference, here is an [example namespace](https://gitlab.com/zabuzhkofaina), its one [project](https://gitlab.com/zabuzhkofaina/zabuzhkofaina), and its [`.gitlab-ci.yml` file](https://gitlab.com/zabuzhkofaina/zabuzhkofaina/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml).

In your browser, view the namespace and its project(s). Determine if the namespace or project looks suspicious. Does the namespace and project have minimal setup? Were they freshly created very recently and lack activity apart from initial setup? Is the project empty apart from the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that defines the pipeline jobs?

View the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Does its job definition look like a miner? Does it download an executable, possibly a separate configuration file, and then run numerous long-running jobs?

#### Mitigation

Contact the Abuse Team via Slack (`@abuse-team`), and ask them to run `Scrubber` for the namespace ids you identified above as abusive.

Quick reference:

- [Scrubber runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/abuse-team/abuse/wikis/Runbook/Mitigation-Tool-%28Scrubber%29)

## Shared CI Runner Timeouts

The shared runner managers have timeouts that can restrict the time a CI job is allowed to run. In a runner config, there is a _Maximum job timeout_ field that is described by the following: `This timeout will take precedence when lower than project-defined timeout and accepts a human readable time input language like "1 hour". Values without specification represent seconds.`

Manually changing this can be done per shared runner manager in the GitLab admin interface under `Admin Area -> Overview -> Runners`. Select, or search for the runner managers you want to increase (or decrease) the runtime timeout for.

API bulk update idea:

```bash
for runner in 157328 157329 380989 380990; do
  curl -sL \
       -H "Private-Token: $GITLAB_COM_ADMIN_PAT" \
       -X PUT  "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/runners/$runner" \
       -F 'maximum_timeout=5400' | jq '"\(.description): \(.maximum_timeout)"'
  sleep 1
done
```
