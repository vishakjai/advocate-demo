# AI Gateway rate limits

LLM providers apply limits to concurrency, requests per minute, input tokens per minute, and output tokens
per minute, which are configured in the AI Gateway (see
[the Inference limits documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/-/blob/main/docs/inference_limits.md))

If our usage is approaching or exceeding these limits, we may need to request an increase. See provider-specific
instructions below.
