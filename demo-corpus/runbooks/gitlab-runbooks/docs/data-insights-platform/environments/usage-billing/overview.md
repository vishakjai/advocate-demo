# Data Insights Platform - Usage Billing

## Overview

These Data Insights Platform (DIP) instances help ingest consumption-based `billable_usage` events from internal consumption services, e.g. AI-Gateway (AIGW) and export it to `customerdot` ClickHouse Cloud instances.

Following is a brief overview of its setup in these environments:

![DIP Overview](./DIP_Usage_Billing.png)

- production: `billing.prdsub.gitlab.net` on `prdsub` GKE environment.
- staging: `billing.stgsub.gitlab.net` on `stgsub` GKE environment.

## Access to these clusters

- All currently provisioned DIP instances should be accessible to on-call engineers. The access to these underlying GKE clusters follows our standard VPN-based tool chain as documented [here](https://runbooks.gitlab.com/kube/k8s-oncall-setup/#kubernetes-api-access).
- In case of other folks needing access to these environments, an access request needs to be created - [for example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/39796).

## Cluster Topology

Within these environments, we setup DIP in the `single-deployment` mode which allows us to run __all DIP components within the same statefulset__. This deployment mode keeps our topology simple to begin with.

> Note, if needed, we _can_ run each of the components in their own deployments/statefulsets to scale cluster throughput further.

For example, on the `stgsub` GKE cluster:

```text
➜  ~ kubectl -n data-insights-platform get statefulset
NAME                            READY   AGE
data-insights-platform-single   3/3     70d

➜  ~ kubectl -n data-insights-platform get pods
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
data-insights-platform-ingress-nginx-controller-596f47b544vdgr6   1/1     Running   0          11d
data-insights-platform-single-0                                   1/1     Running   0          20h
data-insights-platform-single-1                                   1/1     Running   0          20h
data-insights-platform-single-2                                   1/1     Running   0          20h
```

We can of course, scale the statefulset to multiple replicas - in this case 3.

## Observability

## How data flows across these system(s)

For Usage Billing deployments, following is a good representation of how usage-billing data flows across the various systems and/or network boundaries.

![Usage Billing data flows](./DIP_Usage_Billing_dataflows.png)

1. Duo Agent Platform requests and/or workflows are sent to be processed on AIGW.
2. AIGW first calls CustomerDot to check entitlements & allocated GitLab credits to enforce cutoff and/or overages.
3. Once clear to move forward and having processed the request, a corresponding billable_usage event is emitted to billing.prdsub.gitlab.net backed by Data Insights Platform (DIP).
4. DIP ingests & parses these events internally, eventually exporting it to CustomerDot-owned ClickHouse Cloud instance.
5. CustomerDot then fetches these parsed events from their ClickHouse Cloud instance; extracts necessary information from the payload, enriches it as needed and runs all usage-based billing logic.
6. Once processed, fully-enriched events are bulk-uploaded to Zuora via their API for eventual revenue recognition with users/customers.
7. Subsequently, fully-enriched events are also bulk-uploaded to Snowflake for internal analytical purposes.
