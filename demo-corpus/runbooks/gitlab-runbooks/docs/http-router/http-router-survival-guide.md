# HTTP Router: On-Call Survival Guide

This guide helps EOC (engineer-on-call) respond to incidents related to [HTTP Router](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cells/http-router).

## What is HTTP Router

HTTP Router is the entry point for **all** HTTP requests under `gitlab.com/*`. It sits between Cloudflare's edge network and GitLab's backend infrastructure, determining which Cell should handle each incoming request. Currently, by default it proxies requests to our legacy cell.

![](../cells/img/cells-architecture.png)

HTTP Router is built on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and deployed via [http-router-deployer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cells/http-router-deployer/). It enables the [Cells architecture](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/architecture/design-documents/cells/) by presenting all Cells under a single `gitlab.com` domain.

**Design Documentation:** [HTTP Routing Service Architecture](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/architecture/design-documents/cells/http_routing_service)

### What HTTP Router Does

- Routes requests to the correct Cell based on path, headers, or cached classification.
  - Currently, it proxies most requests to our legacy cell. This will change once [path-based routing](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/1745) is enabled.
- Queries [Topology Service](../topology-service/) to identify which cell to proxy requests to (classify).

### What HTTP Router Does NOT Do

- Does not buffer request bodies (memory-constrained)
- Does not handle Git SSH traffic (separate SSH routing)
- Does not perform authentication or authorization (it may extract routing keys from tokens, but validation happens in the backend GitLab application)
- Does not make routing classification decisions itself (core classification logic lives in [Topology Service](../topology-service/))

### How HTTP Router Communicates with Topology Service

HTTP Router authenticates to Topology Service using [Cloudflare Zero Trust Service Tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/). These tokens are:

- Injected via Worker environment variables
- Automatically rotated using a dual-token strategy (Token A rotates 90 days before expiry, Token B rotates 180 days before expiry) to ensure zero downtime
- Managed through [config-mgmt](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/blob/f84b53fbd5bb257b95170c0d00991680c2013306/environments/cloudflare/topology-service-zero-trust.tf)

If there is an issue with service token authentication, you will see **high error rates from the Classify service** as a symptom. In this case:

1. Check [Sentry](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/http-router/?project=39) for authentication-related exceptions
2. Check [Topology Service metrics](../topology-service/) for incoming request failures
3. Review [Cloudflare Access Audit Logs](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/852e9d53d0f8adbd9205389356f2303d/logs/access) for blocked requests

For more details, see [security.md](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cells/http-router/-/blob/main/docs/security.md).

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Sentry for Exceptions

[Sentry Project](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/http-router/?project=39) captures all exceptions across environments (`gprd`, `gstg`).

Exceptions are reported to Sentry via [a separate tail worker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cells/http-router/-/blob/main/docs/observability.md#tail-worker-integration).

### 2. Check Cloudflare Worker Logs

| Environment | Live Logs | Historical Logs |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Production | [Live](https://dash.cloudflare.com/852e9d53d0f8adbd9205389356f2303d/workers/services/live-logs/production-gitlab-com-cells-http-router/production) | [Historical](https://dash.cloudflare.com/852e9d53d0f8adbd9205389356f2303d/workers/services/view/production-gitlab-com-cells-http-router/production/observability/logs) |
| Staging | [Live](https://dash.cloudflare.com/852e9d53d0f8adbd9205389356f2303d/workers/services/live-logs/staging-gitlab-com-cells-http-router/production) | [Historical](https://dash.cloudflare.com/852e9d53d0f8adbd9205389356f2303d/workers/services/view/staging-gitlab-com-cells-http-router/production/observability/logs) |

For detailed logging, see [logging.md](./logging.md).

### 3. Check Cloudflare Metrics

If [Grafana](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/http-router-main/http-router3a-overview) shows missing metrics, check [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/852e9d53d0f8adbd9205389356f2303d/workers/services/view/production-gitlab-com-cells-http-router/production?time-window=1440&versionFilter=all) directly.

See [missing-metrics.md](./missing-metrics.md) for troubleshooting.

### 4. Check Recent Deployments

Review [successful deployment pipelines](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cells/http-router-deployer/-/pipelines?page=1&scope=all&ref=main&status=success) to identify if a recent change caused the issue.

#### Identifying the Currently Deployed Version

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Find latest successful pipeline on main] --> B{Was rollback job triggered?}
    B -->|No| C[Current version = latest pipeline commit]
    B -->|Yes| D[Current version = previous pipeline commit]
    D --> E[Revert the MR that caused the rollback]
```

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Deployment Pipelines](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cells/http-router-deployer/-/pipelines?page=1&scope=all&ref=main&status=success)
2. Find the latest successful pipeline
3. Check if the `rollback` job was triggered on that pipeline
   - If **no rollback**: the commit from this pipeline is what's currently deployed
   - If **rollback was triggered**: the commit from the *previous* pipeline is what's deployed, and you should revert the MR that caused the rollback

> [!note]
> While immediate rollback via the UI is acceptable during incidents, always follow up by reverting the problematic MR to keep the `main` branch aligned with production.

### 5. Check Topology Service Health

HTTP Router depends on Topology Service for request classification. If TS is unhealthy, you'll see classify failures in HTTP Router.

- **Grafana:** [Topology Service (REST) Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/topology-rest-main/topology-rest3a-overview)
- **Quick check:** Are there an increase in 404s across `gitlab.com` ? If yes, start with TS troubleshooting.

For detailed TS troubleshooting, see the [Topology Service Runbook](../topology-service/).

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
| ------- | ------------ | ------ |
| 502 on large uploads | `ReadableStream.tee() buffer limit exceeded` | Check Sentry; review recent MRs for body handling changes |
| Intermittent 502s | Worker memory limits | Check Cloudflare logs for buffer/memory errors |
| High latency | CPU time exceeded | Check CPU metrics in Cloudflare dashboard |
| Missing Grafana metrics | Cloudflare processing delay | Verify via GraphQL API ([missing-metrics.md](./missing-metrics.md)) |
| High error rate on classify requests | Topology Service connectivity or auth issues | Check Sentry for auth exceptions; check [Topology Service health](../topology-service/) |

> [!note]
> There is a known issue on increased error rate caused by `/api/v4/jobs/request` endpoint, the team is working on updating our observability stack to fix the errors coming from here. This will change post <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/tenant-scale/cells-infrastructure/team/-/work_items/632> is closed.

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback

1. Go to [Deployment Pipelines](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cells/http-router-deployer/-/pipelines)
2. Find the last known good deployment
3. Run the rollback job

Details: [Rollback Documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cells/http-router/-/blob/main/docs/deployment.md#rollback)

### Emergency: Disable HTTP Router

> [!important]
> **Assess the impact before disabling.**
>
> With HTTP Router disabled, all requests fall back directly to the Legacy Cell (current `gitlab.com` installation). This is acceptable when no production Cells exist. Once production Cells are active, disabling HTTP Router means:
>
> - Users/groups on the Legacy Cell: **No impact**
> - Users/groups on production Cells: **Will receive 404 errors** (requests won't be routed to their Cell)
>
> Evaluate whether the incident impact is worse than the impact of disabling routing to production Cells.

Use only if HTTP Router is causing critical issues and must be bypassed entirely:

1. Remove or disable routes in [`cloudflare-workers.tf`](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/config-mgmt/-/blob/main/environments/gprd/cloudflare-workers.tf)
2. Create MR, get approval, apply with `atlantis apply`

Details: [disable-http-router.md](./disable-http-router.md)

## Deployment Flow

HTTP Router deploys **separately** from GitLab application:

1. Changes merged to [http-router](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cells/http-router)
2. The project on `gitlab.com` is mirrored to [http-router-deployer](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cells/http-router-deployer/) on `ops.gitlab.net` which runs the deployment pipeline.
2. Progression: `staging` → `production`
