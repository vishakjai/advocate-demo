# DuoWorkflowSvcServiceCheckpointErrorsErrorSLOViolation

## Overview

- This alert fires when the error rate of checkpoint operations exceeds the SLO threshold.
- A checkpoint is the state of a LangGraph graph at a particulat point in time. They are critical for workflow persistence and recovery.
- Duo Workflow Service makes HTTP requests to Rails API (/api/v4/ai/duo_workflows/workflows/:id/checkpoints) to fetch / save checkpoints. They are stored in the Postgres DB.
- This alert indicates that the checkpoint system is experiencing higher-than-acceptable failure rates.
- Possible user impacts
  - Agentic chat loses context from previous messages eg it won't remember previous messages.
  - Users cannot resume software development sessions after a pause event such as tool call approval, user input, etc.
  - Users cannot resume older sessions.

## Services

- [Duo Workflow Service overview](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/tree/master/docs/duo-workflow-svc?ref_type=heads)
- Rails
- Team that owns the service: [Agent Foundations](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ai/agent-foundations)

## Metrics

- The metric used is `gitlab_component_errors:confidence:ratio_1h` and `gitlab_component_errors:confidence:ratio_6h` for the `checkpoint_errors` component of `duo-workflow-svc`.
- This metric measures the error rate of checkpoint operations (4xx and 5xx errors), expressed as a percentage (0-100%).
- The SLO threshold is 5% error rate, meaning the alert fires when errors exceed this threshold.

## Alert Behavior

- To silence the alert, please visit [Alert Manager Dashboard](https://alerts.gitlab.net/#/alerts?silenced=false&inhibited=false&active=true&filter=%7Balertname%3D%22DuoWorkflowSvcServiceCheckpointErrorsErrorSLOViolation%22%7D)
- This alert is expected to be rare under normal conditions. High frequency indicates checkpoint storage or persistence issues.

## Severities

- This alert creates S2 incidents (High severity, pages on-call).
- All gitlab.com, self-managed and dedicated customers (other than those using self-hosted DAP) using Duo Workflow features are potentially impacted, especially long-running workflows.
- Review [Incident Severity Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/#incident-severity) page to identify the required Severity Level.

## Recent changes

- [Recent Duo Workflow Service Production Changes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/-/pipelines?page=1&scope=all&ref=main)
- Since the error could be originated from GitLab REST API, see also recent changes in the GitLab repository, specifically [this endpoint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/ee/lib/api/ai/duo_workflows/workflows_internal.rb#L127).

## Troubleshooting

1. **See checkpoint endpoint logs:**
   - Visit <https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/r/s/VCMrK> or filter by `json.path : *checkpoints` in Rails logs in Kibana.
   - Check the json.status field to see what is the http status code.

2. **Check duo workflow service logs:**
   - Get session IDs from the step 1. You can see the id in the `json.path`.
   - Go to [runway logs for duo workflow service](https://cloudlogging.app.goo.gl/PuutesjcPCF9tBTn7) and filter by `jsonPayload.workflow_id`

3. **Check for recent changes:**
   - Review recent changes mentioned under Recent changes section.
   - Check if a recent deployment affected checkpoint handling.
   - If a recent change caused the issue, consider rolling back.
