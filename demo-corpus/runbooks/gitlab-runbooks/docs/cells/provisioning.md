# Cell Provisioning and De-Provisioning

## Prerequisites

- Configure [`ringctl` in your environment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/ringctl#preparing-your-environment).
- Confirm that you have access to the [`cells/tissue`] project
- Clone the [`cells/tissue`] project locally

## How to Provision a new Cell

[`ringctl`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/ringctl) uses adaptive deployment strategy, i.e it takes reference from the existing tenant_model from a target_ring and replaces only the necessary fields. The cloud provider where a cell should be provisioned must also be provided.

> [!note]
> For most cases you would want to take reference from the `ring 0`.

### Provisioning Steps

#### 1. Create a new tenant using a cell from the target ring as reference

A cell from the given Amp environment, ring, and the requested cloud provider will be used as a reference. A tenant model will be created for a new cell, and it will have the given cell ID. (Cell ID needs to be registered with the topology service, so the user must specify it here.)

```bash
ringctl cell provision --dry-run --amp_environment <cellsdev|cellsprod> --ring 0 --cloud_provider <aws|gcp> --cell_id <cell_id>
```

> [!note]
> When provisioning an AWS cell, this step must always be performed with a local copy of tissue using the flags `--local --chdir /path/to/local/cells/tissue`. This is because we need to manually create an AWS account and replace the placeholder value of the AWS account ID with the new AWS account ID before proceeding to the further steps in this guide.

#### 2. [For AWS cells only] Create AWS account

> [!warning]
> This is a required manual step when creating AWS cells.

We don't have a guide for creating this account at the moment. The steps in this [issue thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/tenant-scale/cells-infrastructure/team/-/issues/438#note_2674769782) can be followed to create an AWS account in the appropriate Amp environment.

Once the AWS account is created, replace the string `PLACEHOLDER-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID` with the generated AWS account ID in the local tenant model file.

#### 3. Create a Merge Request in [`cells/tissue`]

The tenant model for the new cell will be created in your local copy of [`cells/tissue`] at `rings/${amp_environment}/-1/${tenant_id}.json`. The cell *must* always be placed in the quarantine ring -1 at this stage. Create a feature branch from the latest default branch, commit this file, and create a merge request in the [`cells/tissue`] project. The canonical code for `cells/tissue` is on the `https://ops.gitlab.net` GitLab instance.

#### 4. Trigger the [Instrumentor stages] for cell provisioning

Once an MR has been created, the deployment pipeline to trigger Instrumentor stages can be triggered using `ringctl`. The MR *does not* need to be merged at this stage.

```bash
ringctl cell deploy --amp_environment <cellsdev|cellsprod> <tenant_id> --only-gitlab-upgrade=false --branch <feature_branch_name>
```

When all the [Instrumentor stages] pass successfully, the MR that introduces the cell should be merged into the default branch.

> [!note]
> This command will output a link to the cell pipeline which you can use to track the deployment progress.
> The pipeline will run all the Instrumentor stages to create your cell.

> [!note]
> If the provisioned cell needs to be part of the cluster and will be used with other cell services, the cell information must be updated in the topology service like in the example MR <https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cells/topology-service-deployer/-/merge_requests/43>

> [!warning]
> **Only for AWS cells:**
>
> The `provision` stage might fail with an error like the following one:
>
> ```
> │ Error: waiting for EKS Node Group (c01k35wpsh58x0j74g:c01k35wpsh58x0j74g-sidekiq-2025082602513657160000002f) create: unexpected state 'CREATE_FAILED', wanted target 'ACTIVE'. last error: eks-c01k35wpsh58x0j74g-sidekiq-2025082602513657160000002f-5ecc7224-e293-64be-2957-521cd8136265: AsgInstanceLaunchFailures: Could not launch On-Demand Instances.

> A quota increase for the newly created AWS account is requested automatically by Instrumentor in accordance with the reference architecture that was chosen for the cell. This happens in the [`onboard` stage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/instrumentor/-/blob/e36eae24c365b167b27063170fe990bb0b906cd6/aws/onboard/modules/onboard-regional/service-quotas.tf#L32). Quota increases are not instant on AWS: They can take up to 2 days to be approved and applied to an account. So, the `provision` stage should be retried _after_ the quota increase has been approved.

> The `prepare` stage might fail with an error where Amp is unable to assume the `dedicated/preparation` role within the newly created AWS account.

> The `prepare` stage might fail on the initial run with an error like:

Enable it by visiting <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/cloudkms.googleapis.com/overview?project=9065488916> then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry.
> ```
>
> This is expected as the cell project was just created and Google is still enabling the API. Retry the job after approximately 10 minutes to resolve this issue.

#### 5. Access the new cell

- Once the pipeline completes successfully, access your cell through the domain specified in the `managed_domain` field of the `TENANT_MODEL`
- **Example:** `https://cell-<tenant_id>.gitlab-cells.dev`

## How to Move Cells between Rings

Moving Cells between Rings is a logical operation that only impacts when the destination ring receives a new patch.
Cells in Quarentine (-1) Ring do not recieve any automation.
All other Rings will receive operations in order.

### Moving A Cell into Quarantine

1. Using `ringctl`:

    ```bash
    % ringctl cell quarantine <cell-id> --ring <ring-id> -b <branch-name>
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>Example Run</summary>

    ```bash

    You can open a merge request visiting
          https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cells/tissue/-/merge_requests/new?merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=jts%2Ftest

    ```

    </details>

2. Open the Merge Request using the provided log output containing a link
3. Obtain review, approval, and merge the MR.

## How to Move a Cell Out of the Quarantine Ring

This is currently a manual process.

1. Interrogate the target cell configuration and the target Ring destination
2. Validate the version of Instrumentor is the same.
3. Validation the configuration of the cell is the same.
3. Validate the version of GitLab is installed, is the same.
5. If any of the above differ, [create a patch](./patching/creating.md) to address any concerns.
6. If the target cell is in a sane state, create an MR which moves the JSON file from the -1 directory to the target Ring directory
7. Obtain review, approval and merge the MR.

## How to De-Provision a Cell

1. **Ensure the target cell is in the quarantine ring:**
   - If not already there, create an MR to move the cell definition to the `-1` folder (quarantine ring)
   - Get the MR approved and merged

2. **Trigger the tear-down pipeline:**

   ```bash
   ringctl cell deprovision --cell <tenant_id> --ring -1 -e <cellsdev|cellsprod>
   ```

   > [!note]
   > This command will output a link to the cell pipeline which you can use to track the tear-down progress.

3. **Remove the cell definition:**
   - After the tear-down pipeline completes successfully, create an MR to delete the cell definition file from [`cells/tissue`](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cells/tissue/)
   - Get the MR approved and merged
