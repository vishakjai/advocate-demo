# How to resize Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes

Suppose you have some Persistent Volumes attached to Pods from a Controller
(StatefulSet/Deployment/DaemonSet) and you need to increase their size because
it is getting full. Kubernetes supports volume expansion by default (>=
Kubernetes 1.24).

This feature allows Kubernetes users to simply edit their PersistentVolumeClaim
objects and specify new size in PVC Spec and Kubernetes will automatically
expand the volume using storage backend and also expand the underlying file
system in-use by the Pod without requiring any downtime at all if possible.

You can only resize volumes containing a file system if the file system is XFS,
Ext3, or Ext4.

## Procedure

As an example here, we will be resizing the Persistent Volumes for the
Deployment `receive-gitlab-thanos-compactor` from 10GiB to 20GiB.

### Step 1: Preflight checks

- [ ] Verify storage class supports volume expansion `kubectl get storageclass`
- [ ] Make sure your PVC size changes in Helm/ArgoCD/other are ready to merge
      and deploy (but don't merge yet!)
- [ ] Confirm you have access to the targeted Kubernetes cluster as [described
      in the runbook](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/docs/kube/k8s-oncall-setup.md#accessing-clusters-via-console-servers)

### Step 2: Check the current state

Check that the current Persistent Volume Claim in the targeted resource matches
its original definition, and than the existing Persistent Volumes are really
those you are targeting and that their original size also matches:

```
$ kubectl -n thanos describe Deployment/receive-gitlab-thanos-compactor
Name:               receive-gitlab-thanos-compactor
Namespace:          thanos
CreationTimestamp:  Wed, 04 Oct 2023 05:50:04 +0100
Labels:             app.kubernetes.io/component=compactor
                    app.kubernetes.io/instance=receive-gitlab
                    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
                    app.kubernetes.io/name=thanos
                    helm.sh/chart=thanos-12.11.0
...
  Volumes:
   objstore-config:
    Type:        Secret (a volume populated by a Secret)
    SecretName:  receive-gitlab-thanos-objstore-secret
    Optional:    false
   data:
    Type:       PersistentVolumeClaim (a reference to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace)
    ClaimName:  receive-gitlab-thanos-compactor
    ReadOnly:   false
...
Events:          <none>

$ kubectl -n thanos get pvc receive-gitlab-thanos-compactor

NAME                               STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE    VOLUMEMODE
receive-gitlab-thanos-compactor    Bound    pvc-897d200e-b8af-4fd0-a5ac-a7142b2662b9   20Gi       RWO            pd-balanced    16d    Filesystem
```

Nothing unexpected? Great, let's proceed!

### Step 3: Merge your Merge Request

After the pipeline ran, you can check if the PVC has been resized. A few minutes
later the file system is resized online by Kubernetes.

```
$ kubectl -n thanos get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/component=compactor -o wide

NAME                               STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE    VOLUMEMODE
receive-default-thanos-compactor   Bound    pvc-d4590947-3b34-4d59-9f36-44ff6bc1a11b   10Gi       RWO            pd-balanced    48d    Filesystem
receive-gitlab-thanos-compactor    Bound    pvc-897d200e-b8af-4fd0-a5ac-a7142b2662b9   100Gi      RWO            pd-balanced    19d    Filesystem
receive-ruler-thanos-compactor     Bound    pvc-9847345f-493e-4c90-81f1-918313169004   10Gi       RWO            pd-balanced    48d    Filesystem
```

If alerts were firing due to reaching the saturation threshold, confirm that
they aren't firing any longer.

If everything is looking good, you're finished!

## Rollback

Please be aware that it is not possible to shrink a PVC. Any new Spec whose size
reverts the PVC to its previous size (is less than the current one) will be
rejected by the Kubernetes API.

## Stateful Sets

Stateful sets do not automatically resize when updating the corrosponding set, see: [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/661)

Instead what you'll want to do is make the update in helmfiles as usual and apply it, then you'll need to make a manual change to each pvc;

0. Make your changes in gitlab-helmfiles as usual, and apply it prior to the steps listed here.

1. Find the relevant pvc, there's a bunch of ways to do this - for this example ill be using the mimir compactor pvc.

```bash
$ kubectl -n mimir get pvc | grep compact
storage-mimir-compactor-0                  Bound    pvc-cf8dd77f-b178-4327-95a0-790e71515b5d   30Gi       RWO            pd-balanced    40d
```

2. Manually adjust the pvcs' .spec.resources.requests.storage to the same value as you set in helmfiles. Do this for each item in the statefulset.

3. Each altered pvc should now have a condition like this:

```
  - lastProbeTime: null
    lastTransitionTime: "2023-11-28T12:33:24Z"
    message: Waiting for user to (re-)start a pod to finish file system resize of
      volume on node.
    status: "True"
    type: FileSystemResizePending
```

4. Scale the statefulset to 0, then back to whatever it was before:

```
# There's only 1 pod in mimir/compactor;

kubectl -n mimir scale statefulsets/mimir-compactor --replicas=0
sleep 5 # Give it a moment for pity's sake.
kubectl -n mimir scale statefulsets/mimir-compactor --replicas=1
```

5. Confirm new size, revel in your newfound powers

```
$ kubectl -n mimir get pvc | grep compact
storage-mimir-compactor-0                  Bound    pvc-cf8dd77f-b178-4327-95a0-790e71515b5d   50Gi       RWO            pd-balanced    40d
```

## StatefulSets: Changing the volumeClaimTemplate size

The procedure above covers the case where only the PVC data needs to grow, and the StatefulSet's `volumeClaimTemplate` does not change. However, when you also need to update the `volumeClaimTemplate` size in helmfiles or ArgoCD, a different approach is required.

Kubernetes does not allow mutating a StatefulSet's `volumeClaimTemplate`. Attempting to apply a helmfiles/ArgoCD change that modifies it will be rejected by the Kubernetes API as long as the StatefulSet object exists. The solution is to **orphan-delete** the StatefulSet before applying the new configuration — this removes the StatefulSet controller but leaves all pods and PVCs running and intact.

### Step 1: Prepare your helmfiles MR

Make your `volumeClaimTemplate` size change in helmfiles (or ArgoCD) and open a MR, but **do not merge it yet**.

### Step 2: Orphan-delete the StatefulSet(s)

Deleting with `--cascade=orphan` removes the StatefulSet object without touching the pods or PVCs it manages:

```bash
kubectl delete statefulset <statefulset-name> -n <namespace> --cascade=orphan
```

If the StatefulSet spans multiple replicas across zones (e.g. one StatefulSet per zone), repeat for each:

```bash
kubectl delete statefulset mimir-store-gateway-us-east1-b -n mimir --cascade=orphan
kubectl delete statefulset mimir-store-gateway-us-east1-c -n mimir --cascade=orphan
kubectl delete statefulset mimir-store-gateway-us-east1-d -n mimir --cascade=orphan
```

### Step 3: Resize the PVCs

Patch each PVC to the new size. Use a label selector to target the relevant PVCs:

```bash
NAMESPACE="<namespace>"
SIZE="<new-size>"  # e.g. 250Gi

PVC_LIST=$(kubectl get pvc -n $NAMESPACE -l <label-selector> -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')

for PVC in $PVC_LIST; do
  echo "Patching PVC $PVC to new size $SIZE"
  kubectl patch pvc $PVC -n $NAMESPACE -p '{"spec": {"resources": {"requests": {"storage": "'$SIZE'"}}}}'
done
```

To find the right label selector for your StatefulSet's PVCs:

```bash
kubectl get statefulset <statefulset-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector.matchLabels}'
```

### Step 4: Merge your helmfiles MR

Once the PVCs are resized, merge the helmfiles MR. ArgoCD/Helm will recreate the StatefulSet with the updated `volumeClaimTemplate`, and the pods will be rescheduled against the already-resized PVCs.

### Step 5: Verify

Confirm that the StatefulSet is recreated, pods are healthy, and PVCs reflect the new size:

```bash
kubectl get statefulset <statefulset-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -l <label-selector>
kubectl get pvc -n <namespace> -l <label-selector>
```

### Rollback

Once PVCs have been resized they cannot be shrunk. If you have orphan-deleted the StatefulSet but not yet merged your helmfiles MR, you can recreate the StatefulSet at the original size manually to restore the controller — however the PVC resize itself is irreversible.
